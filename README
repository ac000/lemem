A simple utility to run a program while limiting the amount of memory it can
use, using Linux's cgroups memory controller (CONFIG_MEMCG).

Usage is as simple as

    $ lemem [-s] -m <memory limit in MB> -- <program> [args ...]


If you have CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP you can also pass the -s option which will
effectively disable the use of swap for the process.

It should be installed setuid root (4755) with owner:group root. It will drop
back to the users Real GID/UID before executing the specified program.
